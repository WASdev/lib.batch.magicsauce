 * <p>The Doctor Batch's Magic Sauce library provides an abstraction layer for developing batch applications in the 
 * java programming language independent of the specific batch runtime provider, and provides adapters to consume 
 * MagicSauce applications in both WebSphere Application Server's Modern Batch and WebSphere Liberty Profile's Java EE Batch
 * environments. MagicSuace also supplies a library of reusable batch artifacts for JSR-352 or MagicSauce applications.</p>
